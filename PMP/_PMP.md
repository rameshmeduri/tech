#### Measuring Agile Success – Key Metrics

##### 1 Velocity – How Much Work the Team Completes
- Measures the average number of story points completed per sprint

##### 2 Sprint Burndown – Tracking Work Progress
- Shows how much work remains during the sprint

##### 3 Lead Time & Cycle Time – Speed of Delivery
- Lead Time: Time from work request to completion
- Cycle Time: Time from starting work to delivery

##### 4 Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) – Workflow Analysis
- A visual chart showing work in different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done)

##### 5 Escaped Defects – Quality Indicator
- Tracks the number of bugs found in production



phases
------
- initiation
- planning
- execution
- monitoring & controlling
- closing


- A project is a temporary effort aimed at creating a unique product with a defined beginning and end
- A program, on the other hand, is a collection of related projects managed together


scope change

- documenting the change request
- assessing its impact on the project’s timeline, budget, resources
. After evaluating the implications, I obtain formal approval from stakeholders before updating the project plan. Clear communication and revision of project documents ensure that all team members are aligned with the new scope.





In a past project, I had to decide whether to delay the release due to quality issues or meet the deadline with known risks.


identifying potential risks early, assessing their likelihood and impact, and developing mitigation strategies


To handle project delays, I first analyze the root causes and assess their impact on the overall timeline


proposed changes are documented, evaluated for impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources, and reviewed with stakeholders

facilitating open discussions between the conflicting parties, work towards a mutually acceptable solution

monitor progress against the project plan

When communicating bad news, I approach it with honesty and transparency

My communication style is transparent and collaborative




when a critical resource is going for a leave, as a project manager how do you address this issue

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable components or tasks


- I prefer Agile for projects requiring flexibility and rapid iteration
- as it allows for adaptive planning and continuous value delivery

- well-defined requirements and less need for change, 
- I use Waterfall for its structured approach and clear milestones

- I select methodologies based on project complexity, stakeholder needs, and the desired level of adaptability

clearly defining the project scope at the start and implementing a formal change management process

Agile's iterative approach allowed for flexibility in accommodating changes


project charter - It serves as a reference document that guides project planning and execution

identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks

A Gantt chart is a visual tool used in project management to illustrate the project schedule





1 Project Planning & Initiation

- Define Clear Objectives – A well-crafted Project Charter aligns teams and stakeholders.
- Stakeholder Management – Identify, analyze, and engage stakeholders early.
- Scope Clarity – A well-defined Scope Statement prevents scope creep.
- Risk Management – Use a Risk Register to assess and mitigate uncertainties.

2 Project Execution & Monitoring

- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) – Break projects into manageable tasks.
- Agile vs. Waterfall – Choose the right methodology based on project needs.
- Regular Status Updates – Use dashboards and reports to track progress.
- Risk & Change Control – Have a structured approach to handling project changes.

3 Communication & Leadership

- Effective Communication Plans – Tailor messaging for different stakeholders.
- Team Collaboration Tools – Leverage tools like Jira, Trello, or MS Project.
- Conflict Resolution – Address issues proactively to maintain team synergy.

4 Project Closure & Lessons Learned

- Project Review Meetings – Capture what worked and what didn’t.
- Final Documentation – Ensure project artifacts are archived properly.
- Celebrate Success – Acknowledge team efforts and client satisfaction.

Final Thought

Successful project management is not just about tools—it’s about adaptability, leadership, and continuous improvement. Apply these best practices, keep learning, and lead with confidence! 




Key Takeaways from the 100-Day Journey
