##### What is Agile ?
- Agile is guided by the Agile Manifesto ( `4 values` / `12 principles` )
- Agile is a project management and product development approach
- emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback
- Unlike traditional waterfall methods, where project phases are linear and sequential
- Agile promotes an iterative process where teams deliver small, incremental improvements
- The core idea is to adapt to change rather than resist it
- enabling teams to respond quickly to shifting priorities and market demands

##### Key Characteristics of Agile:
• **Iterative Development**: Work is completed in short cycles (sprints or iterations)
• **Customer Collaboration**: Continuous feedback ensures alignment with user needs
• **Flexibility**: Changes can be incorporated at any stage of development
• **Self-Organizing Teams**: Teams have the autonomy to decide how to best complete their work
• **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives help refine processes over time

##### Agile Values ( 4 )
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

1. Customer Satisfaction
2. Welcome Change
3. Frequent Delivery
4. Collaboration
5. Motivated Teams
6. Face-to-Face Conversation
7. Working Software
8. Sustainable Development
9. Technical Excellence
10. Simplicity
11. Self-Organizing Teams
12. Reflection


##### When Agile is the Right Fit
- Projects with Evolving Requirements
If requirements are likely to change, Agile provides flexibility to adapt
Example: A startup developing a new app that adjusts based on user feedback
- Fast-Paced, Uncertain Environments
Agile helps teams respond quickly to market shifts and new information
Example: Product teams in competitive industries where innovation is constant
- Customer-Centric Development
If frequent customer feedback is needed, Agile ensures alignment with real needs
Example: A SaaS company building software features based on user input
- Cross-Functional, Collaborative Teams
Agile thrives in environments where teams can self-organize and make decisions
Example: Marketing teams running Agile campaigns with iterative testing

##### When Agile May Not Be the Best Choice
- Fixed-Scope, Highly Predictable Projects
A traditional approach may work better if all requirements are well-defined upfront and unlikely to change
Example: Construction projects where blueprints and regulations are fixed
- Regulatory or Compliance-Heavy Industries
Some industries require strict documentation and approvals that may not align with Agile's iterative nature
Example: Medical device development requiring FDA approvals
- Large-Scale, Interdependent Systems
If a project requires rigid dependencies and sequential execution, Agile may create inefficiencies
Example: Infrastructure projects like building a highway or bridge
- Organizations with Rigid Cultures and Resistance to Change
Agile requires a mindset shift; if leadership and teams are resistant, implementation may fail
Example: Traditional corporations with strict hierarchies and silos


##### Measuring Agile Success – Key Metrics

##### 1 Velocity – How Much Work the Team Completes
- Measures the average number of story points completed per sprint

##### 2 Sprint Burndown – Tracking Work Progress
- Shows how much work remains during the sprint

##### 3 Lead Time & Cycle Time – Speed of Delivery
- Lead Time: Time from work request to completion
- Cycle Time: Time from starting work to delivery

##### 4 Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) – Workflow Analysis
- A visual chart showing work in different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done)

##### 5 Escaped Defects – Quality Indicator
- Tracks the number of bugs found in production
